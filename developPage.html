          In one of my technology courses, I was able to work hands on with many tools and equipments. I learned how to fabricate wood-working projects using construction machinery, learning how to properly dress lumber and effectively use machines. Throughout this experience I also reinforced proper safety standards in the woodshop. Additionally, I was able to do electrical circuitry, building multiple circuits which included lamps, switches, outlets, and learning how to use the service panel properly. All of these hands-on projects helped me to gain confidence in using new tools and providing resources for ideas to come to life.

          As a part of an ongoing Makers Club project, I have been building this 3D printed bionic arm which is controlled by the movements of a hand using the glove pictured. The electronics is based off of an Arduino Uno Microcontroller and resistence sensitive flex-sensors in order to detect movement. This information is then related to the corresponding servo motor which acts a pulley connected to each finger in order simulate similar hand movement.

       <div class="make-row2">To the right is an archived project, but I was still very proud to be apart of it! This was the first project in my Makerspace Club where I had to work with arts, mechanical, electrical, and coding. As you can probably tell, we were creating a life-sized BB8 robot--from scratch. This involved creating the exterior, building a inner motor chasis, and using a motor shield and Ardunio based circuit connected to a bluetooth module to control his movements using a remote control app.</div>

       <div class="make-row3">Below are some example of how I incorpoate 3D printing and electronics to create unique projects. The first was a button controlled spaceship LED light I designed, and the second is a multivibrator LED circuit I made using a dim-lighting potentiometer for a bike light I designed.</div>

      <div class="make-row6">I was nominated to represent my school at the Peel Science fair showcasing my experiment in measuring the energy outputs of convential fans versus my fan created to change speed based on surrounding temperatures. This complex circuit for which I made this schematic for, (if you would like the full project, let me know!) uses PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) through an NPN transistor and a DHT11 Humidity and Temperature sensor connected to an Arduino and 12V DC Fan. It is programmed to read the sensor and adjust the speed of the fan based on set ranges for the PWM.

       <p>After my co-op placement with Apple, I was invited to speak at a school to girls from elementary to secondary grades about my journey of getting into coding and making. I also shared some advice about how to we can develop more innovative and creative mobile apps when we put our personality and "touch" into all that we create.

      <p>As a part of the initative of "Print it Forward", we used 3D printed parts in order to build another 3D printer for a neighbouring school, assiting them in getting setup with using CAD software and learning how to troubleshoot their own 3D printers.
